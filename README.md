# ps2-to-ble

## Turn your old PS2 keyboard to Bluetooth keyboard.

### This project is havily influenced by two libraries:

1. FabGL by [Fabrizio Di Vittorio](https://github.com/fdivitto/fabgl), which brings to **ESP32** Display Controller (VGA, Color NTSC/PAL Composite, I2C and SPI displays), PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard Controller, Graphics Library, Sound Engine, Graphical User Interface (GUI), Game/Emulation Engine and ANSI/VT Terminal
2. ESP32 BLE Keyboard library by [T-vK](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard). Key definition has been changed to get library compatible with FabGL.
